# Ada Subtype Constraint Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains a simple procedure that attempts to assign a value outside the defined range of a subtype.  The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to handle this error gracefully using exception handling.

This is a frequent issue for Ada beginners and a good example of the importance of careful subtype definition and exception handling.
